# Neovim Config

This is my personal setup inspired by the ones from:
- [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua)
- [tjdevries](https://github.com/tjdevries/config_manager/tree/master/xdg_config/nvim)

After cloning just let it install packer and plugins and restart neovim.

Some keybindings/plugins depend on:
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [tmux-sessionizer](https://github.com/jrmoulton/tmux-sessionizer)
- [neovide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide) (if you'd like a gui)

**_Someday_ it will become decent (maybe)**
